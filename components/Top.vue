          I am currently a third-year PhD student at Waseda University, where I
          am advised by Professor
          <a
            href="https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=4B-C50EAAAAJ&hl=en"
            target="_blank"
            >Shigeo Morishima</a
          >. I am also a member of
          <a href="http://www.leading-sn.waseda.ac.jp/"
            >Waseda Innovation Leading Laboratory (WILL)</a
          >
          and <a href="http://xpaperchallenge.org/cv/">cvpaper.challenge</a>. My
          research interests are primarily in Robust Machine Learning to develop
          ML tools that are robust, reliable and ready for real-world
          deployment.

          I prefer to study new things and always try to keep changing. Nothing
          is permanent.
